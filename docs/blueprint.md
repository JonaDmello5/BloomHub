## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft green (#8FBC8F) to represent the earth and foliage, evoking a sense of nature and growth.
- Background color: Light, desaturated green (#F0FFF0) for a calm and readable environment.
- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA) for highlighting elements and interactive components, reflecting floral beauty.
- Body text: 'Literata', a transitional serif known for readability in extended text.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', a modern, but not distracting, sans-serif font with a computerized feel to create the ideal combination for the site.
- Use soft, outlined icons representing different flower types (roses, orchids) and gardening tools (watering can, shovel) to provide visual cues for navigation.
- Employ a clean, two-column layout where appropriate to avoid long line lengths and create a magazine-like feel, balancing text with supporting images and tip boxes.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as a smooth sliding effect on gallery images or a fade-in effect when loading new content.
